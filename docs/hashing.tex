\section{Hashing a message}
Hashing functions are able to take a variable length message and from it create a fixed length output, a hashing function will always hash the same input to the same output. Cryptographic hashing functions, here-in simply  have two distinct properties which mean they are used in a range of security applications, they should be collision-free and one-way.

 The number of distinct possible outputs of a hashing function of fixed length $L$ is $2^L$ theoretical digests. The are clearly vastly more valid inputs as the input may be of an arbitrary length, therefore there are necessarily collisions, due to the pigeon-hole effect. It is important however that there is no determinable connection between the message, $m$, and the digest, $H(m)$. $H$ should generate sufficiently random digests such that given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item it should be hard to find some $m_1$ and $m_2$ where $m_1 \neq m_2$ and $H(m_1) = H(m_2)$, this is the \textbf{collision-free property}. This property is desirable because
  \item given a digest $h$, it should be computationally infeasible to find any $m$ where $h = H(m)$. This is \textbf{first pre-image resistance}, this ensures it is difficult to retrieve a hashed message.
  \item  an input $m_1$, and the digest $H(m_1)$ it should be infeasible to find a second message $m_2$ where $m_1 \neq m_2$ and $H(m_1) = H(m_2)$, this is \textbf{second pre-image resistance}. When a message and hash are found, it should be infeasible to find more messages which hash to the same value.
\end{itemize}
\label{sec:propeties_of_a_hash}

\paragraph{The Random Oracle} An ideal fixed-length hashing function will play the role of a Random Oracle. acts as a theoretically optimal cryptographic primitive. In a Random Oracle, for a given input a truly random output is chosen and the input and corresponding output are recorded. If the same input message is presented to the oracle at a later point the oracle will return the previously generated value, however for each novel input presented a random corresponding output will be generated.\\

There are many cryptographic hash functions, many vary in success at fulfilling the properties described. Yet they are integral cryptographic primitives on which many secure protocols are built. Successful cryptographic functions have many uses. In most operating systems user passwords are not stored in plain text, doing so would allow a user who maliciously gained access to the password store to know a user's password. Instead password hashes are stored and on login a user submits the password, which is hashed and verified against the stored hash, if these match then the user is authorised. {\color{red} or signing digital documents and distinguish two large messages without having to do explicit bit-wise comparison between each document, easily identify matches or inconsistencies. }

\section{The Merkle-Damg\r{a}rd Construction}
The aim is to build a hashing function $H$ which takes an abitrary length message to create a digest, $\{0,1\}^* \xrightarrow{H} \{0,1\}^n$ in the same fashion as a random oracle would. In practice creating a straight-forward hashing or block cipher to take arbitrary input is impractical, most modern hashing functions, take some compression-function and repeatedly apply it to successive blocks of the message.

If there is a compression function $f$ is suitably provably random then it is possible to create a equally provably random $H$ by using Merkle-Damg\r{a}rd (MD) construction \cite{Merkle1979}. The function taken a message an splits it into blocks of equal length therefore the construct only works on messages which have length, $L$ where $$L \equiv 0 \text{ (mod } n).$$

\subsection{MD-Compliant padding}
It is therefore necessary to apply padding to the original message. In the initial proposal Merkle simply padded the message with zeros\cite{Merkle1979}. This is sufficient to keep the important property of the construct, if $f$ is collision resistant, so is $H$, but more generally MD-compliant padding follows the following three rules. For messages $m$, $m_1$ and $m_2$ in the possible message space.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m$ must be a prefix of $\Pad(m)$.\\\emph{The padding must be applied to the end of the message.}
    \item \textbf{if} $|m_1| = |m_2|$ \textbf{then} $|\Pad(m_1)| = |\Pad(m_2)|$.\\\emph{Two messages of the same length should pad to equal lengths also.}
    \item \textbf{if} $|m_1| \neq |m_2|$ \textbf{then} last block of $\Pad(m_1) \neq$ last block of $\Pad(m_1)$.\\\emph{This is to prevent a very simple suffix collisions, demonstrated in section \ref{sec:md5pad}.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The General Hashing Function}
Algorithm \ref{alg:hashing} shows the basic form of the MD construction. Though many modern hashing algorithms are based on the MD principle, including the SHA series \cite{fips} of hashes, these often make changes to the construct to side-step specific vulnerabilities in the original design. Here $f$ can be any collision-resistant compression function and it will take an initialising vector and the current message block, $b_i$ and updates the IV to produce $H$, a collision-resistant hashing function. Figure \ref{fig:mdpic} illustrates the blocking of the original message, the presence of the padding element and the processing of the IVs.

\subsection{Weaknesses of the MD Construction}
As cryptanalysis has progressed the number of attacks on the MD construction itself has increased\cite{r1}\cite{r2}. It is important to note that these are not attacks on the specific compression functions used and direct attacks on MD and therefore would reduce the work needed to find collisions even using a random-oracle compression function.

\subsection{Length-Extension Attack}
The first weakness of the simple MD construction is that once a single collision has been found it is trivial to find more\cite{Sasaki2006}. 

Let $H: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ be a hashing function and two distinct messages $m_1$ and $m_2$ are a collision pair, that is $H(m_1) = H(m_2)$, under the simple MD construction it is trivial to generate more collisions by appending the collision-causing message with a common message $x$ producing $H(m_1||x)$, $H(m_2||x)$.  Where $||$ is the concatenation operator.

\section{The MD5 Hashing Function}

\subsection{The MD5 Compression Function}

\section{Attacking MD5}
An attack on a hacking function attempts to circumvent the secure properties that a hashed message should have: the one-way property and the collision-free property, discussed in section \ref{sec:propeties_of_a_hash}.
A firt pre-image attack focuses on finding a message which has a particular hash-value, therefore circumventing the one-way property and tries to find $m$ where $\hash{m}$ is known. A further attack, a \emph{second-preimage} attack, where the original message $m_1$ is known, attempts to find another message $m_2$ where $\hash{m1} = \hash{m2}$.
A collision attack attempts to find any two arbitrary messages $m1$ and $m2$, where $\hash{m1} = \hash{m2}$.

\subsection{Collision Attacks}
Hoffman,of the Network Working Group, in 2004 discussed that the dominant hashing attacks are collision attacks. Considering the `birthday problem' it is possible to estimate how many evaluations of the hash function it would take to find a collision in a given hashing function. Given a message space of  $2^n$, where $n = 128$ for MD5, the `birthday bound' for a binary string is $2^{(n/2)}$; $2^{64}$ for MD5. This is a theoretical bound and is reliant on the `perfection' of the hashing function, that is that each possible 128-bit output should be equally likely and there should be no inferable connection between input and output. 

Although many collisions have now been found for the MD5 hash, the first publicly announced collision was from Dobbertin in 1996 \cite{dobbertin}. The MD5 function processes the message to be digested into 64-byte chunks (blocks) and the collision detailed by Dobbertin relies on using previous blocks to put initialisation vectors of the Merkle-Damgård construction into a specific state, from this state their are two distinct . This is not considered to be an attack on the full MD5 function; as a single message isn’t presented which causes a collision, but from 1996 the MD5 construction has been widely considered `broken’ with respect to being collision-resistant.

\end{figure}

There have been many distributed project which have tasked themselves with finding MD5 collisions on the full algorithm and the first of this to report results was MD5CRK\cite{cryptoeprint:2004:199}. This project yielded two full colliding message pairs for the MD5 algorithm and also collisions for the MD4, RIPEMD and HAVAL-128 protocols. Each message presented for MD5 was made of two blocks, each first block was identical and has the effect of forcing the MD construction into using a fixed IV while processing the second block which can be given two distinct blocks and still produce the same hash. The MD5CRK algorithm spent the majority of its time finding a block which is able to generate an exploitable IV, after this is found it took very little time to produce a second block which is able to break collision-resistance.

\subsection{Pre-image attacks}
Producing and publishing a collision, may not present a security problem for many uses of hashes, producing a collision for a hashed password may be enough to enter a single system but doesn't necessarily give the attacker the plaintext password. The hashed information is still safe. Once victim to collision attacks most cryptographers will avoid a hash\cite{dontusemd5}, yet more crippling to the reputation of hashing function is a pre-image attack.

For a given $H$: $\{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ a pre-image attack on a hash, $h$ requires retrieving $m$ where $h = H(m)$. For an ideal $H$ (which strictly models a Random Oracle) a brute-force attack is necessary, for MD5 this should take $2^{128}$ evaluations of the MD5 function for an arbitrary $m$.

Performing pre-image attacks on arbitrary hashes is clearly a time-consuming task it is therefore desirable to perform some pre-computation to make performing multiple attacks faster, this time-memory tradeoff attempts to save chains of hashes which cover all of a sub-space of the entire message-space. 

For a hash $H$: $\{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ and a finite password set $P$; one example might be alpha-numeric strings less than 9 characters in length. The perfect data-structure is, for each password in $P$ store $p$ and $H(p)$, this is infeasible and would require storage $\text{O}(|P| \times n)$ bits of storage.

\paragraph{Hash chain tables}
Instead a reduction function $R$ is produced to take a hash and produce a new message from it, where $h \in H$ and $p \in P$. $R$ produces the mapping $h \rightarrow p$, this allows for an alternating chain of \emph{message to hash to message\dots} to be produced.

To generate a hash-chain table\cite{Hellman1980}, a random set of passwords from P is selected. Each of these is hashed, then the resulting hash is gien to the reduction function. This is hashed, this process is repeated $k$ times, this is the chain length. Instead of storing the entire chain, simple the starting point and the last password are stored. 
\begin{center}
    password $\xrightarrow{H}$ \textsc{2867c6a4} $\xrightarrow{R}$ tadcaacc $\cdots$ nomzyaw$\xrightarrow{H}$ 3b5440e1 $\xrightarrow{R}$ bffbbecf
\end{center}
Here only `password' and `betaffbbecf' need to be stored to retrace every password seen while creating the table.

To use the table to attack a hash $h$, firstly the hash is passed through the reduction function, to produce a candidate password $p$, if this $p$ appears in the set of endpoints of the table then the corresponding starting password is selected and the series of hash-reductions is applied until the original $h$ is seen, the $p$ which generated $h$ is the plaintext preceding $h$ in the chain. 
It isn't guaranteed that this search will be successful as multiple hashes are likely to reduce to the same $p$, this is illustrated figure \ref{fig:col}.

\end{figure}

As the number of chains created increases the likelihood of collisions increases also. A collision occurs when to chains produce the same value and continue hashing, this is likely to be due to a collision on the password, as hashing functions are generally considered to be collision resistant.

Selecting an appropriate reduction function is a critical part of the design of a hash-chain table. It is important to know a lot about the possible possword domain as constraining the search to this area will be more useful and a smaller table may be generated covering the likely password space with less gaps, increasing the chance of finding the hash and its inverse. It is also important to generate the correct distribution of messages, it may be inefficient to create many short passwords if the space is up to 9 character for example. Needless to say designing an appropriate reduction function is difficult.

\paragraph{Rainbow Tables}
The largest shortcoming of simple hash-chain tables is that the number of collisions increases as the table size increases. To counter-act this in 2003 Oechslin\cite{Oechslin}.proposed a method for using multiple reduction function to drastically reduce the effect that a single collision has on the production of a chain in a table. This approach is called a rainbow table and is the dominant approach to launching pre-image attacks on hashign functions today.

\section{Side Channel Attacks}
A side channel attack is an attack on the physical implementation of the cryptosystem the main attacks are based on the fact there is 'effecient' ways to do certain mathmatical functions on a processor based on what they values they are processing this is usually branching dependent on wether the bit 0 or 1. 

\subsection{Power Attacks}
There are two types of Power Attacks using Simple Power Analysis(SPA) is just watching the trace of the power flowing through the processer while it is performing the functions this shows the load on the processer and from that work out what action is being done. Peter Kocher outlined using DES in ?? showing that you can see the distinct rounds in the DES structure.
